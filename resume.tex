            \item {Transitioned from monolith to microservice architecture to
              ensure scalability while {\bf maintaining a cyclomatic complexity
              of 5 or lower.} This made it possible for teams to function more independently
              and increased the org's velocity}
            \item {Refactored systems to {\bf reduce query times by
              99.9\%} by introducing covering indices and lateral joins into
              our PostgreSQL database. This allowed the database to be downsized which
              lowered operational costs.}
            \item {{\bf Lead the company's "Frontend Guild"} to educate and
              elevate the organization's frontend engineers. We explored topics
              like the transition to React 18, when to use various state
              management solutions, as well as a general best practice consensus.}
            \item {Rewrote legacy React components to {\bf remove unnecessary global
              state} + abstractions allowing for a {\bf ~75\% reduction in total
              lines of code} for a microfrontend}

                  improving the core 15Five Check-in feature} of our app.}
            \item {Cultivated a healthy atmosphere by encouraging direct
                  reports to bring their full selves to work through regular
                  1-on-1's, performance reviews, and role clarity discussions

            \item {{\bf Developed end to end solutions} for all feature work. We
                  typically began by establishing scope before writing and
                  presenting an implementation plan and tickets. During the
                  development cycle I would {\bf write code and review
                  100\% of the relevant pull requests}.}

            \item {Implemented TypeScript adoption at an org level. I
              worked with several other developers to {\bf enforce static
              typing on 100\% of our React components}. This was part of the
              effort that allowed our DevOps team to embrace CI/CD and {\bf
              decrease cycle time by 50\% org-wide}.}

            \item {Architected and built an extensible framework to simplify
                  app-wide rich text editing. I began by investigating existing
                  usage in order to determine the proper abstractions before 
                  {\bf removing 1000s of lines of duplicated code and
                  several abstraction layers} from our codebase.}
