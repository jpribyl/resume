            \item {Led a team of 4 engineers tasked with maintaining and {\bf
                  improving the core 15Five Check-in feature} of our app which
                  helped increase company MRR by 25\% this year while reducing churn
                  by 11\%.}
            \item {Cultivated a healthy atmosphere by encouraging direct
                  reports to bring their full selves to work through regular
                  1-on-1's, performance reviews, and role clarity discussions
                  which led to {\bf 100\% retention of the engineers on my team}.}
            \item {{\bf Collaborated with designers, product managers, mobile
                  engineers, and other teams} while participating in customer calls

        \begin{itemize}

            \item {{\bf Developed end to end solutions} for all feature work. We
                  typically began by establishing scope before writing and
                  presenting an implementation plan and tickets. During the
                  development cycle I would {\bf write code and review
                  100\% of the relevant pull requests}.}

            \item {Implemented TypeScript adoption at an organization level. I
                  worked with several other developers to {\bf enforce static
                  typing on 100\% of our React components}. This, combined with
                  our effort to increase frontend test coverage allowed the
                  DevOps team to embrace CI/CD and {\bf decrease
                  cycle time by 50\% org-wide}.}

            \item {Architected and built an extensible framework to simplify
                  app-wide rich text editing. I began by investigating existing
                  usage in order to determine the proper abstractions before 
                  {\bf removing 1000s of lines of duplicated code and
                  several abstraction layers} from our codebase.}

                  This feature has {\bf grown into our most adopted feature}. In
                  order to implement this, we had to {\bf integrate custom React hooks
                  and functional components into legacy jQuery} business logic.}
